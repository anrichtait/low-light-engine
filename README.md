# Low Light Game Engine
Welcome to the Low Light Game Engine. This is a hobby project being worked on by [me](link.com). I post regular dev/study logs on my [blog](link.com) where I go into implementing the features I added in the engine.

*Low Light Engine* is focused on 2D game prototyping and development for my personal projects. The Low Light Engine is designed to be a flexible and modular toolset for 2D game development. Currently, it is in the early stages of development, and as new systems and features are added, this README will be updated with documentation on architecture and implementation details.

> **Stability Notice:** This is an experimental hobby project and is not yet ready for any serious game development and is VERY feature incomplete.
